### About me ###
- 👔 My current day job is as a Project Manager. I have also experience as a 🔫[Combat System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9LV) supervsior, and ♟Modelling guided weapon trials in [simdis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMDIS) and [sadm](https://www.baesystems.com/en-aus/what-we-do/sadm).
